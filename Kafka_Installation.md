### 2 Kafka installation
#### 2.1 Download Apache Kafka

Click on the following link where is located the archive:
https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi?path=/kafka/3.2.1/kafka_2.13-3.2.1.tgz

![Kafka01](https://snipboard.io/gRH2FV.jpg)


Copy the link

* In case that you don't have homebrew installed, use the following command:
~~~
$ brew ins/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
~~~

Execute the following command to install wget
~~~
$ brew install wget 
~~~

Now we use the following command to install the kafka:
~~~
$ wget (link that you copy before)
~~~

Once that is downloaded execute the following command:
~~~
$ tar -xvzf kafka_2.13-3.2.1.tgz 
~~~

Open the folder "kafka_2.13-3.2.1"
~~~
$ cd kafka_2.13-3.2.1
~~~

#### 2.2 zookeeper and kafka configuration

In order to make the communication we need to modify the configuration in kafka and the zookeeper. Lets modify it.
~~~
$ cd config/
$ vim server.properties
~~~

Once that you are inside the config locate the line where it says "advertised.listeners", it should be in a comment.
![Kafka02](https://snipboard.io/qPw7Kj.jpg)
We are going to change the text for:
~~~
adversited.listeners=PLAINTEXT://local.host:9092
~~~

In the same file locate the line where it says "zookeper.connect"
Replace it with:
~~~
zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181
~~~

Save the file using the button
":" and after pressing that button write "wq"

Go to the previous folder (kafka_2.13-3.2.1)
~~~
$cd .. 
~~~

Activate the zookeeper:
~~~
$ bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
~~~

Open a new terminal or window terminal and lets run the kafka server.
~~~
$ cd kafka_2.13-3.2.1
$ JMX_PORT=8004 bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties 
~~~

So both servers are now connect.
