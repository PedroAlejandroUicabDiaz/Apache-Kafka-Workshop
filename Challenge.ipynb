    "# Challenge: Simulate a real-time chat\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this challenge is for you to simulate a real-time chat of an Twich streammig using the concepts learned during the Apache Kafka workshop. Essentially you will create a Kafka Producer to send 3 types of messages to the previously provided Kafka Consumer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create a new topic:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new topic on a Command Prompt. The new topic must be named as **workshop**, and it will have a replication factor of 1, and only 1 partition.   \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the commmnad:\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "kafka-topics.bat --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic {Topic_Name}\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables:**\n",
    "- *channel_name* (str) - string of the Twich's channel name.\n",
    "- *usernames* (list) - list of **at least 10** strings with random nametags.\n",
    "- *random_messages* (list) - list of **at least 10** strings with random messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods:**\n",
    "- *donation(list)* - creates a message of the form: *{username} has donated {0-50} USD!*. Consider that **{variable} will selected randomly.**\n",
    "- *suscribe(list,str)* - creates a message of the form: *{username} has suscribed to {channel_name}!*. Consider that  **{variable} will selected randomly.**\n",
    "- *rand_message (list,list)* - creates a message of the form: *{username}: {random_message}!*. Consider that  **{variable} will selected randomly.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kafka Producer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kafka producer has to send the 3 types of messages in a random way, (in each iteration it must select randomly the type of message to send) in order to create the illusion of a real-time chat with variable messages. Consider to **wait some time** (between 1-3 seconds) when the producer is sending each one of the **at least 15** messages to the consumer. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Kafka Consumer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the same *Consumer.ipynb* notebook to visualize the real-time chat, but make sure to change the topic of the consumer to match with your new topic **workshop**. "
